> Initial appearance
> When bottom sheets initially appear on screen, they may contain content that extends below the bottom of the screen. They can be swiped or dragged up to become full-screen. Depending on the content, bottom sheets can also become full-screen by tapping on their surface or an expand icon.

> When full-screen, bottom sheets can be internally scrolled to reveal additional content. A toolbar should be used to provide a collapse or close affordance to exit this view.
